# How C++ works

* Anything that begins with a hash(#) is a **preprocessor statement**. The first things that a compiler does when it receives the source files is to preprocesses all the preprocessor statements. 

* During compilation, all CPP files get compiled. Header files will not be compiled. They are pasted into CPP files via the preprocessor statements(#include<>) and that's when they get compiled.

* The result of compiling the CPP files are some individual OBJ files(one for each CPP files). We need a tool to stitch them together into one EXE file. That tool is the **linker**.

* When you declare a function/symbol in one file but forget to define it, the compiler will not complain. It just trust you that there's a definition somewhere. But the linker's job is to resolve the symbol. It has to wire up all the functions. When it cannot find a definition anywhere, there's a linker error.
